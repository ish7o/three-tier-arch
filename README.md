go > python
`if err != nil` my beloved and try/except just sucks
go has actual concurrency
static typing
can't cast a `Toyota Yaris 2009` to a `string` sorry
GIL sucks
compiled
IndentationError
interfaces, structs
simplicity
batteries not included


## uwu

this API manages user data through these endpoints:
- `GET /users` - shows all users
- `GET /users/<id>` - peeks at one specific user
- `POST /users` - adds a new user to our database
- `PATCH /users/<id>` - updates user info
- `DELETE /users/<id>` - removes a user

## ⭐️

when creating a new user:
```json
{
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "birthYear": 42069,
    "group": "user/premium/admin"
}
```

when getting them back:
```json
{
    "id": 1337,
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "age": 420,
    "group": "user/premium/admin"
}
```

made with <3 in neovim on arch linux in Go because python is too mainstream
